In the future, possibly consider switching to using only a few texture bind slots and just switching out each texture when it needs to be used.
This would mean that only GL_MAX_TEXTURE_IMAGE_UNIT amount of textures can be used in one draw call, but this would eliminate
the need for spritesheets for everything. For a 2D game, using spritesheets should be fine, but as more lighting maps are added it may
become more complicated to handle having to edit large images to change / add new textures.
