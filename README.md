# Electron2D

A 2D game engine written in C#. This project is a self-study meant to give me more experience with large projects and to gain a better understanding of how game engines work.

In order to download and use this respository, a [GLFW pre-compiled binary](https://www.glfw.org/download) must be placed in the build directory.
